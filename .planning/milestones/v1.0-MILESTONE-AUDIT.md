## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: CLI Launch → Logo Display → TUI Start

**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

User runs `codemad` → CLI entry parses args → Logo displayed in usage → TUI launches with theme → Terminal title set to "CodeMAD"

### Flow 2: User Adds Chinese Provider → Auth Plugin → Key Stored

**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

User sets env var → Provider state init checks auth → Plugin system loads INTERNAL_PLUGINS → Auth plugin registered → Loader returns apiKey → Provider available

### Flow 3: TUI Loads → Theme Applied → Brand Colors Display

**Status:** ✓ COMPLETE

TUI launches → ThemeProvider initialized → codemad theme loaded as default → Theme resolved → Colors applied (#FF3300 primary)

## Quality Gate Results

| Check     | Status                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Typecheck | ✓ PASS (12 packages)                |
| Tests     | ✓ PASS (9/9 Chinese provider tests) |
| Build     | ✓ Ready                             |
| Lint      | ✓ No blocking issues                |

## Tech Debt

**None accumulated.** All code is substantive, properly wired, and follows existing patterns.

## Anti-Patterns

**None detected.** No TODOs, no stubs, no placeholders in Phase 1 deliverables.

## Human Verification Required

The following items were flagged for human testing (visual appearance):

1. **Terminal Window Title** — Verify "CodeMAD" displays in terminal title bar
2. **CLI Banner Colors** — Verify CODE in white, MAD in red
3. **TUI Banner Colors** — Verify MAD portion uses red accent from theme
4. **Session Titles** — Verify "CM | [session]" format

These are visual checks that require human confirmation but do not block milestone completion.

## Conclusion

Phase 1 (Fork Foundation) **passes audit**:

- ✓ 4/4 requirements satisfied
- ✓ 5/5 plans complete
- ✓ 10/10 integration score
- ✓ 3/3 E2E flows complete
- ✓ Zero tech debt
- ✓ Zero anti-patterns
- ✓ All quality gates pass

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Context Intelligence).**
